# Grocery_Online_Shopping_App
This is a NodeJS Microservices Architecture. I have built a simple Online Grocery Shopping Application using ES6 using a Monolithic architecture and segregated into Microservices architecture without impacting front end. So each individual service will work independently to serve the purpose and business logic.
